dialogue~Ayzax~“Look what I found!”
dialogue~MC~He’s lugging the damaged thruster up, leaping from boulder to boulder. I can’t help but stare.
comment~(Get THRUSTER)
dialogue~MC~“Whoa.”
dialogue~Ayzax~“I know! I can’t believe it was right there!”
dialogue~MC~“I think it’ll still work with some repairs, too. Thanks.”
dialogue~MC~“Is this your book?”
dialogue~Ayzax~“Yes! I’ve been working hard on it. Every adventurer needs a logbook!”
dialogue~Ayzax~“Feel free to look at my discoveries!”
dialogue~MC~I open the book.
comment~(Open book appears in lieu of dialogue. It’s full of crappy drawings about “great discoveries” like “this rock tastes like soap” and “swinging from vines is really cool.”)
dialogue~MC~“I’m speechless.”
dialogue~Ayzax~“Thank you! Oh, since I’m an explorer, I can help you get some food for your journey back, too!”
dialogue~MC~“Really? That’s nice of you.”
dialogue~MC~I have to admit, my Earth food has been running out. I ate all the good stuff first and now I’m down to breakfast bars, protein powder, and dried bananas.
dialogue~Ayzax~“Just let me know what you need!”
comment~-If you have the other two items already:
dialogue~MC~“I think that’s everything. Can you help me get that back to the ship?”
dialogue~Ayzax~“Of course! Lead the way!”
comment~-If you don’t have all the other items yet:
comment~--MC~“I still need to look around some more.”
comment~--Ayzax~“That’s fine! I can just get this back to your ship! Adventurer, away!”
