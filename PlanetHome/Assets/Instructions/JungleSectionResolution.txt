Playsound~Kasma_Thanks
Dialogue~Kasma~“That’s it! Thanks again. Hey, you should check out my exhibition in the town square. It’s in a few days. I call it, “Smash the System: Sponsored by Spacebook.”
Dialogue~MC~“Sounds great, but… I’m actually trying to get my ship repaired. I crashed on this planet while exploring the system.”
Playsound~Kasma_Don-t-Worry
Dialogue~Kasma~“Rough. Don’t worry, though. This town’s full of people who like to help out.”
Dialogue~MC~“Even strangers? I know it’s probably rude to ask, but I lived in one of those small towns with 600 people, the ones that are always named after body parts. For locals, they held parties and raised barns and fixed cars. A stranger came in who looked wrong, the cops would sit back and watch the town rowdies try and run them off the road.”
Dialogue~Kasma~“Of course strangers. It’s the right thing to do.”
Playsound~Kasma_Hey-check-this-out
Dialogue~Kasma~“Hey, check this out! It’s a solid, flexible metal rod. Looks a little better than my old antenna, even.”
Dialogue~Kasma~“You think this’ll help with your ship?”
Dialogue~MC~“Yeah, that’s perfect. That’ll help me send and receive data.”
Playsound~Kasma_Here-you-go
Dialogue~Kasma~“Great! Here you go, it’s only fair. I don’t see the other things you mentioned here, though.”
