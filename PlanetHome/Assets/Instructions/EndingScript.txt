dialogue~MC~I have to tell them.
dialogue~MC~“Thank you. All of you. But…”
dialogue~MC~“Can I… think about it?”
dialogue~Kasma~“About what?”
dialogue~Gloonk~looks thoughtfully at me and the ship.
dialogue~Gloonk~“I think I understand.”
comment~TODO: playsound~do_whats_best_for_you
dialogue~Gloonk~“Go ahead. Do what’s best for you.”
dialogue~MC~“...”
dialogue~Ayzax “Waiiiiiiiit. I don’t get it.”
dialogue~Kasma~“Wait. You mean you want to stay?”
dialogue~MC~“You all helped me. You’ve been so nice.”
dialogue~Gloonk~“Of course! It’s the right thing to do.”
playsound~Ayzax_A-true-adventurer
dialogue~Ayzax~“You helped us, too! You braved the mountains to retrieve my book, with the spirit of a true adventurer!”
dialogue~MC~“I know it’s a big thing to ask, but I just don’t feel like my planet is… home. I don’t even think there’s anyone left who would miss me.”
playsound~Kasma_Who-Cares
dialogue~Kasma~“Who cares what they think? Forget the establishment. You want to stay, you’re ours. Simple as that.”
dialogue~MC~I didn’t know what I thought would happen. But as they all start to smile, even Gloonk~with that face, my heart starts beating harder.
dialogue~MC~“I know we all just spent all that time rebuilding my ship, but…”
dialogue~Ayzax~“But that’s great! It’s just like a mobile home!”
dialogue~MC~“You have those on this planet?”
dialogue~Ayzax~“You just need some furniture now.”
dialogue~Ayzax~“Maybe a new washing machine.”
dialogue~Kasma~“Bookshelf wall?”
dialogue~MC~“Everyone…”
dialogue~Gloonk~“We can introduce you to the rest of the town. If you need anything, just call us.”
dialogue~MC~“...Yeah. You can count on me, too.”
dialogue~MC~As I look up into the sky, leaving my old world behind, I wonder.
dialogue~MC~Maybe I won’t go back now.
dialogue~MC~But in the end, home is the place I came to. The place where I was welcomed all along.
